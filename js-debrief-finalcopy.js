// 1. Create a function declaration that takes in the following array of numbers, and returns a new array made up only of the odd numbers.

randomNumsArr = [3, 64, 57, 98, 23, 1373, 2498, 12, 23, 540, 31];







// 2. Create an arrow function that takes the array from above and returns only the numbers that are divisible by 3.









// 3. create a function expression that uses arrow function syntax. The function takes in an array of words and returns a new array that only includes words from the input array that are no longer than 5 characters long. You cannot use a for loop, but may only use an iterator method.

const wordsArray = ['helloo', 'hellooo', 'hello', 'worldd', 'world', 'woorld'];









// 4. Create an arrow function that takes the array from above and returns only two-digit numbers.
